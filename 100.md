# NIP-100 WebRTC
`draft` `optional` `author:jacany`

This NIP defines how to do WebRTC communication over nostr.

## Defining Rooms
Rooms are essentially the space that you will be connected to. This must be defined by a `r` tag following the pubkey of the person you are connected to or some other identifier (maybe a lobby id for a joinable voice channel, etc.)

## Peers
Who the client connects to can be chosen by the client. Ex: you can connect to everyone peer-to-peer or a WebRTC media server that is listening on nostr relays.

## Encryption
The `content` field and `r` tag of types `offer`, `answer`, and `candidate` should be encrypted, similarly to `NIP-04`.
Clients MUST listen for the `p` tag containing their pubkey so they know that event is intended for them

⚠️ `content` FIELDS SHOULD BE JSON STRINGIFIED, AND THEN ENCRYPTED. ⚠️

### Broadcasting that you are present
Announces that the client is ready to connect to others.
The connection ID is inferred from the provided pubkey.
```json
{
    "kind": 25050,
    "pubkey": "<sender pubkey>",
    "tags": [
        ["type", "connect"],
        ["r", "<plaintext room id>"]
    ]
}
```

### Closing
This is used when disconnecting from everybody else. Ex: when browser tab is closed.
```json
{
    "kind": 25050,
    "pubkey": "<sender pubkey>",
    "tags": [
        ["type", "disconnect"],
        ["r", "<plaintext room id>"]
    ]
}
```

### Offering to connect
Used when responding to a `type:connect`. Offering to connect to that peer.
```json
{
    "kind": 25050,
    "pubkey": "<sender pubkey>",
    "tags": [
        ["type", "offer"],
        ["p", "<reciever>"],
        ["r", "<encrypted room id>"]
    ],
    "content": {
        "offer": "<offer>",
        "type": "offer"
    }
}
```

### Answering an Offer
```json
{
    "kind": 25050,
    "pubkey": "<sender pubkey>",
    "tags": [
        ["type", "answer"],
        ["p", "<reciever>"],
        ["r", "<encrypted room id>"]
    ],
    "content": {
        "sdp": "<sdp>",
        "type": "answer"
    }
}
```

### Broadcasting ICE Candidate
```json
{
    "kind": 25050,
    "pubkey": "<sender pubkey>",
    "tags": [
        ["type", "candidate"],
        ["p", "<reciever>"],
        ["r", "<encrypted room id>"]
    ],
    "content": {
        "candidate": "<sdp>",
        <misc>
    }
}
```
